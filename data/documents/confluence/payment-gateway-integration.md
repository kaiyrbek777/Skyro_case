```

### Error Handling
Implement exponential backoff for retries:
- Initial retry: 1 second
- Max retries: 3

### Webhook Configuration
All gateways must send webhooks to:
```
https://api.skyro.com/webhooks/payment-events
```

Required webhook events:
- payment.succeeded
- payment.failed
- payment.refunded
- dispute.created

## Security Requirements

1. **PCI DSS Compliance:** All payment data must be tokenized
2. **TLS:** Minimum version 1.2
3. **Data Retention:** Card data must NOT be stored
4. **Logging:** Log transaction IDs only, never card numbers

## Testing

### Test Credentials

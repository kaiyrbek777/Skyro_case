- Total transactions: 487,000
- Success rate: 98.2%
- Average latency: 342ms
- Uptime: 99.97%
- Total processing costs: $387,450

**Issues Identified:**

- Higher than expected decline rates for international cards (4.2%)
- Limited support for local payment methods (needed for EU expansion)

**Action Items:**
- [Kevin] Set up failover to backup gateway by Feb 1
- [Maria] Investigate international card decline reasons

### 2. Cost Analysis: Stripe vs. Adyen

**Stripe:**
- **Pros:** Easy integration, great documentation, fast settlement
- **Cons:** Higher fees (2.9% + $0.30), limited enterprise features
- **Monthly cost** (based on volume): ~$390K

**Adyen:**
- **Pros:** Lower fees (2.2% negotiated), enterprise features, global coverage
- **Cons:** Complex integration, 3-month implementation time
- **Projected monthly cost:** ~$280K (28% savings)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Savings: $110K/month = $1.32M/year
- Integration cost: $180K (engineering time + consulting)
- **Payback period:** 1.6 months

**Decision:** ‚úÖ Approved to proceed with Adyen integration

### 3. Phase 2 Gateway Additions

**Approved:**
- ‚úÖ Adyen (primary for enterprise customers)
- ‚úÖ PayPal (alternative payment method)

**Deferred to Q3:**
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Square (low priority for our use case)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Cryptocurrency gateways (regulatory concerns)

**Rationale:**
Focus on payment methods that serve EU expansion goals and enterprise segment.

- Week 5-6: Security review and PCI compliance
- Week 7: Load testing (target: 5,000 TPS)
- Week 8: Gradual rollout (1% ‚Üí 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)

**Phase 2: PayPal Integration (4 weeks)**
- Parallel development starting Week 3
- Simpler integration (existing SDK)
- Target completion: End of March

### 5. Risk Assessment

**High Risks:**

**Risk 1: Integration Complexity**
- **Impact:** High (could delay launch)
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Hire Adyen-certified consultant, add 2-week buffer
- **Owner:** Maria

**Risk 2: Dual-Gateway Transaction Routing**
- **Impact:** High (could cause payment failures)
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing, feature flags for quick rollback
- **Owner:** James

**Medium Risks:**

**Risk 3: Stripe Vendor Lock-in**
- **Impact:** Medium (harder to migrate existing merchants)
- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Design abstraction layer, gradual migration plan
- **Owner:** Maria

**Risk 4: Increased Operational Complexity**
- **Impact:** Medium (more systems to monitor)
- **Probability:** High
- **Mitigation:** Unified monitoring dashboard, runbook documentation
- **Owner:** Kevin
